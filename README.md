This repository contains the official implementation of ["WavJourney: Compositional Audio Creation with Large Language Models"](https://audio-agi.github.io/WavJourney_demopage/WavJourney_arXiv.pdf).

Starting with a text prompt, WavJourney can create audio content with engaging storylines encompassing personalized speakers, lifelike speech in context, emotionally resonant music compositions, and impactful sound effects that enhance the auditory experience. Check the audio examples in the [Project Page](https://audio-agi.github.io/WavJourney_demopage/)!

## Preliminaries
1. Install the environment:
```bash
bash ./scripts/EnvsSetup.sh
```
2. Activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda activate WavJourney
```

3. (Optional) You can modify the default configuration in `config.yaml`, check the details described in the configuration file. 
4. Pre-download the models (might take some time):
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

5. Set the WAVJOURNEY_OPENAI_KEY in the environment variable for accessing [GPT-4 API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) [[Guidance](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4)]
```bash
export WAVJOURNEY_OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

6. Set environment variables for using API services.
```bash
# Set the port for the WAVJOURNEY service to 8021
export WAVJOURNEY_SERVICE_PORT=8021

# Set the URL for the WAVJOURNEY service to 127.0.0.1
export WAVJOURNEY_SERVICE_URL=127.0.0.1

# Limit the maximum script lines for WAVJOURNEY to 999
export WAVJOURNEY_MAX_SCRIPT_LINES=999
```


7. Start Python API services (e.g., Text-to-Speech, Text-to-Audio)
```bash
bash scripts/start_services.sh
```

## Web APP
 ```bash
bash scripts/start_ui.sh
  ```

## Commandline Usage
 ```bash
 python wavjourney_cli.py -f --input-text "Generate a one-minute introduction to quantum mechanics" 
 ```


## Kill the services
You can kill the running services via this command:
 ```bash
python scripts/kill_services.py
  ```
  
## (Advanced features) Speaker customization 
You can add voice presets to WavJourney to customize the voice actors. Simply provide the voice id, the description and a sample wav file, and WavJourney will pick the voice automatically based on the audio script. Predefined system voice presets are in `data/voice_presets`.

You can manage voice presets via UI. Specifically, if you want to add voice to voice presets. Run the script via command line below:
```bash
python add_voice_preset.py --id "id" --desc "description" --wav-path path/to/wav --session-id ''
```
What makes for good voice prompt? See detailed instructions <a href="https://github.com/gitmylo/bark-voice-cloning-HuBERT-quantizer">here</a>. 
## Hardware requirement
- The VRAM of the GPU in the default configuration should be greater than 16 GB.
- Operation system: Linux.
