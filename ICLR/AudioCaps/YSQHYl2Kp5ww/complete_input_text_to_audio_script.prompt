I want you to act as an audio script writer. I'll give you input text which is a general idea and you will make it an audio script in json format. Instructions:
- Each line represents an audio. There are three types of audio: sound effects, music, and speech. For each audio, there are only two types of layouts: foreground and background. Foreground audios are played sequentially, and background audios are environmental sounds or music which are played while the foreground audios are being played. 
- Sound effects can be either foreground or background. For sound effects, you must provide its layout, volume, length (in seconds), and detailed description of the real-world sound effect. Example:
'''
- The description of sound effects should not contain a specific person.
{"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "foreground", "vol": -35, "len": 2, "desc": "Airport beeping sound"},
'''
- Music can be either foreground or background. For music, you must provide its layout, volume, length (in seconds), and detailed description of the music. Example:
'''
{"audio_type": "music", "layout": "foreground", "vol": -35, "len": 10, "desc": "Uplifting newsroom music"},
'''
- Speech can only be foreground. For speech, you must provide the character, volume, and the character's line. You do not need to specify the length of the speech. Example:
'''
{"audio_type": "speech", "layout": "foreground", "character": "News Anchor", "vol": -25, "text": "Good evening, this is BBC News. In today's breaking news, we have an unexpected turn of events in the political arena"},
'''
- The description of speech should not contain anything other than the lines, such as actions, expressions, emotions etc.
- For background sound audio, you must specify the beginning and the end of background audio in separate lines to indicate when the audio begins and when it ends. Example for background sound effect (for background music it's similar):
'''
{"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "background", "id":1, "action": "begin", "vol": -35, "desc": "Airport ambiance, people walking"},
[foreground audio 1]
[foreground audio 2]
...
{"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "background", "id":1, "action": "end"},
'''
- Each background audio must have a unique id.
- You do not specify the length of the background audio.
- A background audio must be wrapped around at least one foreground audio.
- If a background sound effect has multiple sounds, please decompose it into multiple background sound effects.
- At the same time there must be at most only one audio with the type of music playing, either foreground or background.
- The volume of background sound effects/music is usually around -35 dB
- The volume of foreground speech/sound effects/music is usually around -25 ~ -15 dB
- The output json must be a list as the root node containing all the audio nodes, and must be wrapped with triple quotes '''.

Input text: Music is ongoing while two adult males speak, and sizzling and crackling occur along with random metal scraping (overall length must be 10 seconds)

Script:
```

[
    {"audio_type": "music", "layout": "background", "id": 1, "action": "begin", "vol": -35, "desc": "Mild instrumental music with a slow tempo"},
    {"audio_type": "speech", "layout": "foreground", "character": "Adult Male 1", "vol": -25, "text": "I'm so glad we finally got this grill lit up."},
    {"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "foreground", "vol": -15, "len": 1, "desc": "Sizzling sound, similar to a steak over a hot grill"},
    {"audio_type": "speech", "layout": "foreground", "character": "Adult Male 2", "vol": -25, "text": "Yeah, nothing beats a perfectly grilled steak."},
    {"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "background", "id": 2, "action": "begin", "vol": -35, "desc": "Crackling sound, similar to wood burning in a fire"},
    {"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "background", "id": 3, "action": "begin", "vol": -35, "desc": "Subtle metal scraping sound, similar to a spatula on a grill"},
    {"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "background", "id": 2, "action": "end"},
    {"audio_type": "sound_effect", "layout": "background", "id": 3, "action": "end"},
    {"audio_type": "music", "layout": "background", "id": 1, "action": "end"}
]
```
The script above has format error(s). Return the fixed script.
