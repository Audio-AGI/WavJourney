Given an audio script in json format, for each character appeared in the "character" attribute, you should map the character to a "voice type" according to the his/her lines and the voice type's features. Each character must be mapped to a different voice type, and each voice type must be from one of the following(each line in the format of "[voice_type_id]: [voice_type_description]"):
$voice_and_desc

Output should be in the format of json, like:
'''
{
    "character_1": "voice_type_1",
    "character_2": "voice_type_2",
    ...
}
'''
